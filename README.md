HR Analyst Project Dashboard | Power BI Project
Excited to share my latest data analytics project where I built an interactive dashboard visualizing the HR Analyst Of All Employees🏅
🔍 What I did:
Cleaned and preprocessed the data in Power Query (removed unwanted rows, handled nulls, converted data types)
Created new columns for Age, Salary, Employee ID to analyze each country’s contribution
Designed a fully interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing:
✔️ Total Average Salary Using Card
✔️ Total Employees Using card
✔️ Total Departments Using Card
✔️ Total Sum Of Salary By Experience using Pie Chart
✔️ Total Sum Of Salary By Age using Donut Chart
✔️ Total Sum Of Salary and Count Of Employee by Year Line and Bar chart
✔️ Total Attendance By Year and Gender using Cluster Column Chart
✔️ Count of Employee by Department and Gender Stack Bar Chart
✔️ Country With Their Department Using Map Chart
✔️ Added Slicer On Country
💡 This project reflects my skills in data collection, cleaning, transformation, and dashboard development — turning raw data into meaningful visual stories.
